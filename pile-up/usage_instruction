# Pileup JSON Files For Run II

The Pileup JSON files for 2015 can be found at: /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions15/13TeV/PileUp/ and for 2016 files are at : /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions16/13TeV/PileUp/. The most up-to-date is linked to pileup_latest.txt. The Pileup JSON will be updated regularly in the future. To produce your pileup histogram for re-weighting follow the same procedure as for Run-1:

    pileupCalc.py -i MyAnalysisJSON.txt --inputLumiJSON pileup_latest.txt  --calcMode true --minBiasXsec 69200 --maxPileupBin 50 --numPileupBins 50  MyDataPileupHistogram.root

Note that the cross-section value is 69 mb for 2015 and 69.2 mb for 2016.

Note that the recommended minBias cross-section of 80mb for reweighting is currently under review. The best-fit value is determined to be 69.2 mb with an uncertainty of 4.6% Since all analysis JSON`s should only include subsets of Runs and LS`s of the DCS-Only JSON, you in principle do not have to calculate the pile up JSON yourself. Instead, use your specific JSON to mask the pile up JSON provided centrally, as in shown in the example above.

If you want to anyhow calculate the pileup per LS yourself, you can use the script at /afs/cern.ch/user/l/lumipro/public/estimatePileup_makeJSON_2015.py. 


again:

> pileupCalc.py -i MyAnalysisJSON.txt --inputLumiJSON pileup_latest.txt  --calcMode true --minBiasXsec 69200 --maxPileupBin 100 --numPileupBins 100  MyDataPileupHistogram.root

-- also make up to 100 bins
